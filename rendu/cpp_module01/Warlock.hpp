// Add to the Warlock the following member functions:

// * learnSpell, takes a pointer to ASpell, that makes the Warlock learn a spell
// * forgetSpell, takes a string corresponding a to a spell's name, and makes the
//   Warlock forget it. If it's not a known spell, does nothing.
// * launchSpell, takes a string (a spell name) and a reference to ATarget, that
//   launches the spell on the selected target. If it's not a known spell, does
//   nothing.

// You will need a new attribute to store the spells your Warlock knows. Several
// types fit the bill, it's up to you to choose the best one.
